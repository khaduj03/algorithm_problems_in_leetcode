# Search Insert Position - Explanation

This is a solution to the **Search Insert Position** problem using Python.

## Problem Explanation (Simple Version)
You have a list of numbers that are in order. You also have a target number. 
- If the target is in the list, we want to return its position (index).
- If the target is not in the list, we want to return the position where it would go to keep the list in order.

### Example
- If the list is `[1, 3, 5, 6]` and the target is `5`, the answer is `2` because `5` is already at position 2.
- If the target is `2`, the answer is `1` because `2` would go between `1` and `3`.

## Code Explanation
Here is the Python code:

```python
class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums)  # Start with the full range of the list
        while l < r:  # Keep searching until the range is empty
            mid = (l + r) // 1  # Find the middle position
            if nums[mid] >= target:
                r = mid  # Move the right pointer to the middle
            else:
                l = mid + 1  # Move the left pointer past the middle
        return l  # Left pointer is now the answer
```

## How It Works 
1. Start with two pointers:
   - `l` is at the beginning of the list.
   - `r` is at the end of the list.
2. Look at the middle number of the list.
3. Compare the middle number with the target:
   - If the middle number is **bigger or equal** to the target, move the right pointer (`r`) to the middle.
   - If the middle number is **smaller**, move the left pointer (`l`) past the middle.
4. Repeat until the two pointers meet. 
5. The left pointer (`l`) will show where the target should be.

### Example Walkthrough
#### Input: `nums = [1, 3, 5, 6]`, `target = 5`
1. Start: `l = 0`, `r = 4` (list size is 4).
2. Middle: `mid = (0 + 4) // 2 = 2`. `nums[2] = 5`.
   - `nums[mid] == target`, so we return `2`. Done!

#### Input: `nums = [1, 3, 5, 6]`, `target = 2`
1. Start: `l = 0`, `r = 4`.
2. Middle: `mid = (0 + 4) // 2 = 2`. `nums[2] = 5`.
   - `nums[mid] > target`, so move `r = mid = 2`.
3. Middle: `mid = (0 + 2) // 2 = 1`. `nums[1] = 3`.
   - `nums[mid] > target`, so move `r = mid = 1`.
4. Middle: `mid = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`. `nums[0] = 1`.
   - `nums[mid] < target`, so move `l = mid + 1 = 1`.
5. Now `l == r == 1`. Return `l = 1`.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)` because we divide the list in half each time.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` because we use only a few variables.

## Additional Information
- This solution works only if the list is already sorted.
- It's a very efficient way to search for numbers compared to checking each one.
